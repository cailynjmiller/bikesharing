## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to show investors the potential success of a bike-sharing program Des Moines, Iowa by showing usage trends in New York City.

## Results
These graphs show the the total number of bikes (y-axis) and the trip duration (x-axis) separated into 3 sections based on how many hours the ride was and the minutes within that hour. The top graph displays total users and the bottom graph displays 3 line graphs for each gender.

These maps show the popularity of start and ending destinations by having bigger/darker bubbles for the most popular locations and smaller/lighter bubbles for the least popular locations. The top map shows the popularity of starting destinations and the bottom ending destinations.

## Summary
The results show that this is a great investment opportunity for Des Moines. Here are some of the key analyses from these visuals:
- The top two graphs show that people typically take trips that are less than 20 minutes and rarely go over an hour.
- The maps show that rides are typically most popular in the city and less popular in the outskirts.
- The bottom 3 graphs show that rides are most popular during the work week (Mon-Fri) and in the morning before working hours (7-9am) and the afternoon after working hours (4-6pm).
- All of the gender analyses show that males use the bikes at a higher rate than females.

I wanted a better understanding of how age relates to bike usage, so I pulled together two additional analyses which shows that people born between 1985 and 1995 use the bikes the most and those born after 2000 and before 1960 use the bikes the least. It appears that males use the bikes at a higher rate than females consistenly across birth year
